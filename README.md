# Prometheus Demo Service

This app provides predictable synthetic metrics of each type for PromQL training, rather than "realistic" metrics.

## Usage

The easiest way is to pull the Docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/julius/prometheus-demo-service

Alternatively, you can build from source or your own container image.
